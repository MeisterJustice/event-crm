          <p>It is Isellafrica's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating
            our

            (hereinafter,
            "us", "we", or "https://Eventhood.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally
            identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy
            ("Privacy
            Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under
            what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to

          <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general
            rules
            and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you

          <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
          <p>Like most website operators, Isellafrica collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that
            web
            browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
            site,
            and the date and time of each visitor request. Isellafrica's purpose in collecting non-personally
            identifying
            information is to better understand how Isellafrica's visitors use its website. From time to time,
            Isellafrica
            may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends
            in
            the usage of its website.</p>
          <p>Isellafrica also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
            addresses
            for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://Eventhood.com blog posts. Isellafrica only
            discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
            personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

          <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
          <p>Certain visitors to Isellafrica's websites choose to interact with Isellafrica in ways that require
            Isellafrica
            to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Isellafrica gathers
            depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at
            https://Eventhood.com to provide a username and email address.</p>

        <div id="list-item-4">
          <h2>Security</h2>
          <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission
            over
            the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable
            means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

          <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These
            cookies
            allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile
            information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other
            things,
            deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy
            covers

          <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
          <p>Isellafrica discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to
            those
            of
            its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to
            process
            it on Isellafrica's behalf or to provide services available at Isellafrica's website, and (ii) that have
            agreed
            not
            to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located
            outside
            of your home country; by using Isellafrica's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to
            them.
            Isellafrica will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
            to
            anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above,
            Isellafrica
            discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a
            subpoena,
            court order or other governmental request, or when Isellafrica believes in good faith that disclosure is
            reasonably
            necessary to protect the property or rights of Isellafrica, third parties or the public at large.</p>
          <p>If you are a registered user of https://Eventhood.com and have supplied your email address, Isellafrica may
            occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
            date
            with what's going on with Isellafrica and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type
            of
            information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via
            a
            support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
            clarify
            or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Isellafrica takes all measures reasonably
            necessary to
            protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
            personally-identifying
            and
            personally-identifying information.</p>

            goes
